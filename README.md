# Description
This project will help you to find the fastest algorithm for your project.
We have used 5 type of algorithm for first run.
Also there is some addditional information that will be helpful for you:
     1.Algorithms circulations.
     2.Algorithms responsibility.
     3.Algorithms speed differencial.
		 
# Services
This application can make Microsoft Excel charts in-app or in a separate Worksheet.
These charts have some useful values about these algorithms.

# Algorithms
 The algorithms that we have checked are:
      1. Binary Search 
			2. Linear Search 
			3. Quick Sort 
			4. Bubble Sort 
			5. Hanoi Tower
